### library and command-line tool

### application deployment or systems administration tasks

---

### orchestration + remote execution

---

### Similar to Ansible and Capistrano

^ Ansible is popular, supports facts

---

### Why Fabric?

^ ease of use
^ only requires sshd and Python on your laptop
^ extensible - writing Python code
^ out of band of your Puppet infrastructure


---

### Why not mcollective?

^ it has to be installed
^ middleware can hose up
^ sshd is everywhere
^ puppet labs even heading in a different direction

---
